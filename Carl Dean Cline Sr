# Lattice Unified Field Theory (L.U.F.T.) Equation

## The Formula:
\[ R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} + (\text{Pl term}) = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu} \]

### Refined with the Lattice Term:
\[ R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} + \text{Lattice Term (10⁻¹¹ lb/ft²)} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu} \]

### Purpose:
This equation resolves the **cosmological constant discrepancy**:
- Observed Value: ~5.3566 × 10⁻¹⁰ J/m³
- QFT Prediction: ~10¹¹³ J/m³

By introducing the Lattice Term, this approach bridges the gap between General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory predictions.
