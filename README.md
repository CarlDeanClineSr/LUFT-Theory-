# Lattice Unified Field Theory (L.U.F.T.)

## Overview
The **Lattice Unified Field Theory (L.U.F.T.)** represents a groundbreaking approach to reconciling the cosmological constant discrepancy. This repository includes the mathematical models, datasets, and code that form the foundation of this work.

## Key Contributions
- **Equation**: Resolves the discrepancy between observed and predicted values of the cosmological constant.
- **Lattice Term**: A novel addition to the Einstein field equations to bridge General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory.
- **Public Data**: Includes public datasets for further research and validation.
